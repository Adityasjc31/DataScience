    "The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The basic idea behind k-NN is to classify or predict a new data point based on the majority class or average value of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. Here's a numeric example to illustrate the k-NN algorithm for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset with two features, X1 and X2, and a binary classification label (Class) indicating whether a point belongs to class 0 or class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "+-----------------+\n",
    "| X1 | X2 | Class |\n",
    "+-----------------+\n",
    "| 2  | 3  |   0   |\n",
    "| 5  | 4  |   1   |\n",
    "| 9  | 6  |   1   |\n",
    "| 4  | 2  |   0   |\n",
    "| 7  | 5  |   1   |\n",
    "+-----------------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Point:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we have a new data point with X1 = 6 and X2 = 4, and we want to determine its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose k:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a value for k: Let's say k = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate Distances:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Euclidean distance between the new point and all existing points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Distance to point (2, 3): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (4-3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = 4.12\n",
    "    Distance to point (5, 4): sqrt((6-5)^2 + (4-4)^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\n",
    "    Distance to point (9, 6): sqrt((6-9)^2 + (4-6)^2) = sqrt(9 + 4) = 5\n",
    "    Distance to point (4, 2): sqrt((6-4)^2 + (4-2)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = 2.83\n",
    "    Distance to point (7, 5): sqrt((6-7)^2 + (4-5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = 1.41\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find Nearest Neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "For k = 3, find the three nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Nearest neighbors: (5, 4), (7, 5), (4, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Majority Vote:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes of the neighbors: 1, 1, 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Since two out of three neighbors belong to class 1, the new point is classified as class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using the k-NN algorithm with k = 3, the classification for the new point F is Class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the K-NN algorithm predicts that the new point with X1 = 6 and X2 = 4 belongs to class 1 based on the majority class of its three nearest neighbors."
