    "## 29/09/23 - Statistics\n",
    "Population - all the items <br>\n",
    "Sample - portion of population<br>\n",
    "`Two types of datas : `<br>\n",
    "- Primary - Data Collected by ourselves<br>\n",
    "- Secondary - Data given<br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probaility Sample : Simple Random Sample\n",
    " - Every individual or item from the frame has an equal chance of being selected\n",
    "\n",
    " <hr>\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Types of Variables\n",
    "  - Categorical(qualitative)\n",
    "  - Numerical (quantitative)\n",
    "    - Discrete - arises from a counting process\n",
    "    - Continuous - arises from measuring process\n",
    "    If categories have order then it's `oridinal` else it's `nominial` <br>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Levels of Measurement \n",
    " - Interval scale : difference b/w measurements is a meaningful quantity but the measurements do not have a true zero point . Example : temperature in degree celsius or fahrenheit\n",
    "\n",
    " - Ratio scale - is an ordered scale in which the difference between the measurements is a meaningful quantity and the measurements have a true zero point . Example : Height\n",

    "## For Visualizing Categorical Data\n",
    " - Bar Chart -  for categories\n",
    " - Pie Chart - for categories\n",
    " - Histogram - Univariate anaylsis\n",
    " - Scatter - relationship\n",
    " - Line Chart - Condition : Time should be their on horizontal axis\n",

    "## Descriptive Statistics\n",
    " - `Central tendency is the extent to which all the data values group around a typical or central value`\n",
    " - `The variation  is the amount of dispersion or scattering of values / measure of deviation`\n",
    " - `The shape is the pattern of the distribution of values from the lowest value to the highest value`\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measure of Central Tendency\n",
    " - `Mean/Arthmetic Mean` : (X1+X2+......+Xn)/n ; `Used when their are no outliers`\n",
    " - `Median` - if mean has outliers then we look for median (=n/2 and =(n+1)/2) ; `less sensitive to outliers`\n",
    " - `Mode` - most frequent - used for categorical data that is also nominal data\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measure of Variation : \n",
    " - Range - X(largest) - X(Smallest) ; `Ignores the way in which data is distributed`; `Senstitive to outliers`\n",
    " - Variance:\n",
    "   - Low variation : more points close to mean\n",
    "   - High variation : more points far from the mean\n",
    " - Standard deviation\n",
    " - Coefficient of variation\n",
    "\n",
    "`Measures of variation give information on the spread/variablity/dispersion of the data values`\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Sample Variance\n",
    "`Average(approximately) of squared deviations of values from the mean`\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "`Most commonly used measure of variation`\n",
    "`Shows variation about the mean`\n",
    "`Is the square root of the variation`\n",
    "`Has the same units as the original data `\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Standard Deviations\n",
    "`Used when two results in same`\n",
    " - Smaller Standard Deviation\n",
    " - Larger Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locating Extreme Outliers : Z-Score\n",
    "`Z = X - Mean(X)/S`\n",
    "- |Z|<1 for 68% of data\n",
    "- |Z|<2 for 95% of data\n",
    "- |Z|<3 for 99.7% of data\n",
    "\n",
